# QuantConnect AlgoTrading

This project is for us to get familiar with integrating machine learning in algo trading and to experience the quant connect platform. Through this experience, we became familiar with several machine learning models, namely LSTM and decision trees, to optimize our trades. We were also exposed to financial tools and technical indicators that industries apply in trading.

We are still in the process of learning and will keep on updating this repo in the future. Any feedback or any suggestions to help us and improve our learning experience is more than welcomed.
