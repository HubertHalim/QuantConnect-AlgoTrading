# QuantConnect AlgoTrading

We decided to embark on this project to get an understanding of how machine learning can be integrated in algorithmic trading, and to experience the QuantConnect platform. Through this project, we became familiar with several machine learning models, namely LSTM and decision trees, and its trading applications. Concurrently, we were also exposed to financial tools and technical indicators that the industry applies.

We are still in the process of learning and will continue to update this repo in the future. Any feedback or any suggestions to help us and improve our learning experience is more than welcomed!
